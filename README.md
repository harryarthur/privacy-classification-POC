# privacy-classification-POC
Proof of concept for a data privacy classification system

In many respects, cyber securityâ€™s instantiation can be attributed to the requirement to protect sensitive data. It is necessary to safeguard its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Classified information computer networks/systems are an integral aspect of the management of sensitive data in both the civilian and military sectors. The cyber security space is therefore reliant on these systems to protect assets and information from leaks and attacks. 
The primary objective of this project was to design and demonstrate a single, functional proof-of-concept multilevel security system for sensitive data. The final system derives inspiration from the onion routing technique used in the Tor network to facilitate multilevel security handling. This report details the successful design and implementation of such a system. This was achieved using python, Jupyter notebooks and flask web servers. 



## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This project was coded using Python 3.9.1. It is an older but stable release of python. All later released of python will also be compatible with this project. It is recommended to avoid legacy versions of Python (2 and under).

As per the Python documentation, Windows versions 7 or earlier are incompatible. 

The only requisite for installing Jupyter notebook 5.7.8, is Python 3.3 or greater. 

It is also recommended to install Jupyter using pip, Pythons package manager. 

The lightweight flask web flask framework should come preinstalled with Python distributions; however, it can also be installed using pip.



### Executing program

Execute the servers one by one first with 


```
python <servername>.py
```
Then open the notebooks and run cells from Alice first. The order of the others shouldnt matter
